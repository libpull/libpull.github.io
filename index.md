# Description

Libpull is a library that provides all the necessary functions
to perform secure OTA updates for constrained Internet of Things
devices.

During the design phase we targeted Class 1 constrained devices,
thus all the choises were made to reduce memory footprint and
reduce bandwidth.

The library is portable over several RTOS and boards, and is build
on top of interfaces that allows to easily configure it for 
your needs.
